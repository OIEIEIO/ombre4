## Introduction


Our blockchain ensures the highest level of privacy out there by
from the get-go having(1) **Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT)** (2) and hardcoding **minimum transaction _mixin_ to 25**. These settings significantly reduce the chance of being identified, traced or attacked by blockchain statistical analysis.

Ryo developers implemented, **uniform transaction ID system**. The system hides the very fact that you use payment ID in your transaction, since all transactions now have uniform ID in it. This feature is first of its kind among any Cryptonote currencies and is retrofitted with old payment ID system.

Ombre has a very high privacy setting that is suitable for all high confidential transactions as well as for storage of value without being traced, monitored or identified. We call this **true fungibility**. This means that each coin is **equal** and **interchangeable**; it is highly unlikely that any coin can ever by blacklisted due to previous transactions. Over the course of many years these characteristics will pay off as crypto attacks become more sophisticated with much greater computation power in the future.

## Coin Supply & Emission



- **Coin symbol**: **OMB**
- **Hash algorithm**: CryptoNight GPU (Proof-Of-Work)
- **Emission scheme**: Ombre's block reward changes _every 6-months_ according to the following "Camel" distribution. Our emission scheme is inspired by real-world mining production comparable to crude oil, coal and gas which is often slow at first, accelerated in the next few years before declining and becoming depleted. However, the emission path of Ombre is generally not that far apart from Bitcoin.

## Precompiled binaries

Along with each release you can find our [precompiled binaries](Comming Soon).
To verify that the downloaded binaries are created by one of our developer please verify the checksums.
The authenticity of the checksums can be verified with the [PGP-key's](doc/pgp_keys.md).

## Compiling Ombre from source

### Dependencies

The following table summarizes the tools and libraries required to build. A
few of the libraries are also included in this repository (marked as
"Vendored"). By default, the build uses the library installed on the system,
and ignores the vendored sources. However, if no library is found installed on
the system, then the vendored source will be built and used. The vendored
sources are also used for statically-linked builds because distribution
packages often include only shared library binaries (`.so`) but not static
library archives (`.a`).

[^] On Debian/Ubuntu `libgtest-dev` only includes sources and headers. You must
build the library binary manually. This can be done with the following command ```sudo apt-get install libgtest-dev && cd /usr/src/gtest && sudo cmake . && sudo make && sudo mv libg* /usr/lib/ ```

Debian / Ubuntu one liner for all dependencies  
``` sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential cmake pkg-config libboost-all-dev libssl-dev libzmq3-dev libunbound-dev libsodium-dev libunwind8-dev liblzma-dev libreadline6-dev libldns-dev libexpat1-dev doxygen graphviz libpgm-dev```

### Cloning the repository

This repo does not use submodules, so simply clone this repo:

`$ git clone `

If you already have a repo cloned, initialize and update:

`$ cd Ombre-1.5`

### Build instructions

Ombre uses the CMake build system and a top-level [Makefile](Makefile) that
invokes cmake commands as needed.

#### On Linux and OS X

* Install the dependencies
* Change to the root of the source code directory, change to the most recent release branch, and build:

        cd Ombre-1.5 && make

    *Optional*: If your machine has several cores and enough memory, enable
    parallel build by running `make -j<number of threads>` instead of `make`. For
    this to be worthwhile, the machine should have one core and about 2GB of RAM
    available per thread.

    *Note*: If cmake can not find zmq.hpp file on OS X, installing `zmq.hpp` from
    https://github.com/zeromq/cppzmq to `/usr/local/include` should fix that error.

    *Note*: The instructions above will compile the most stable release of the
    Ombre software. If you would like to use and test the most recent software,
    use ```git checkout master```. The master branch may contain updates that are
    both unstable and incompatible with release software, though testing is always
    encouraged.

* The resulting executables can be found in `build/release/bin`

* Add `PATH="$PATH:$HOME/ombre/build/release/bin"` to `.profile`

* Run Ombre with `ombred --detach`

* **Optional**: build and run the test suite to verify the binaries:

        make release-test

    *NOTE*: `core_tests` test may take a few hours to complete.

* **Optional**: to build binaries suitable for debugging:

         make debug

* **Optional**: to build statically-linked binaries:

         make release-static

Dependencies need to be built with -fPIC. Static libraries usually aren't, so you may have to build them yourself with -fPIC. Refer to their documentation for how to build them.

* **Optional**: build documentation in `doc/html` (omit `HAVE_DOT=YES` if `graphviz` is not installed):

        HAVE_DOT=YES doxygen Doxyfile

#### On the Raspberry Pi

Tested on a Raspberry Pi Zero with a clean install of minimal Raspbian Stretch (2017-09-07 or later) from https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/. If you are using Raspian Jessie, [please see note in the following section](#note-for-raspbian-jessie-users).

* `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade` to install all of the latest software

* Install the dependencies for Ombre from the 'Debian' column in the table above.

* Enable zram:
```
	sudo zramctl --find --size=1024M # Note the device name
	sudo mkswap <device name>
	sudo swapon <device name>
```
* Clone Ombre and checkout most recent release version:
```
        git clone Comming Soon
	cd Ombre-1.5
```
* Build:
```
        make release
```
* Wait 4-6 hours

* The resulting executables can be found in `build/release/bin`

* Add `PATH="$PATH:$HOME/Ombre-1.5/build/release/bin"` to `.profile`

* Run Ombre with `ombred --detach`

* You may wish to reduce the size of the swap file after the build has finished, and delete the boost directory from your home directory

#### *Note for Raspbian Jessie users:*

If you are using the older Raspbian Jessie image, compiling Ombre is a bit more complicated. The version of Boost available in the Debian Jessie repositories is too old to use with Ombre, and thus you must compile a newer version yourself. The following explains the extra steps, and has been tested on a Raspberry Pi 2 with a clean install of minimal Raspbian Jessie.

* As before, `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade` to install all of the latest software, and enable zram

```
	sudo zramctl --find --size=1024M # Note the device name
	sudo mkswap <device name>
	sudo swapon <device name>
```

* Then, install the dependencies for Ombre except `libunwind` and `libboost-all-dev`

* Install the latest version of boost (this may first require invoking `apt-get remove --purge libboost*` to remove a previous version if you're not using a clean install):
```
	cd
	wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.64.0/boost_1_64_0.tar.bz2
	tar xvfo boost_1_64_0.tar.bz2
	cd boost_1_64_0
	./bootstrap.sh
	sudo ./b2
```
* Wait ~8 hours
```
	sudo ./bjam install
```
* Wait ~4 hours

* From here, follow the [general Raspberry Pi instructions](#on-the-raspberry-pi) from the "Clone Ombre and checkout most recent release version" step.

#### On Windows:

Binaries for Windows are built on Windows using the MinGW toolchain within
[MSYS2 environment](http://msys2.github.io). The MSYS2 environment emulates a
POSIX system. The toolchain runs within the environment and *cross-compiles*
binaries that can run outside of the environment as a regular Windows
application.

**Preparing the Build Environment**

* Download and install the [MSYS2 installer](http://msys2.github.io), either the 64-bit or the 32-bit package, depending on your system.
* Open the MSYS shell via the `MSYS2 Shell` shortcut
* Update packages using pacman:

        pacman -Syuu

* Exit the MSYS shell using Alt+F4
* Edit the properties for the `MSYS2 Shell` shortcut changing "msys2_shell.bat" to "msys2_shell.cmd -mingw64" for 64-bit builds or "msys2_shell.cmd -mingw32" for 32-bit builds
* Restart MSYS shell via modified shortcut and update packages again using pacman:

        pacman -Syuu


* Install dependencies:

    To build for 64-bit Windows:

        pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain make mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-boost mingw-w64-x86_64-openssl mingw-w64-x86_64-zeromq mingw-w64-x86_64-libsodium

    To build for 32-bit Windows:

        pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-toolchain make mingw-w64-i686-cmake mingw-w64-i686-boost mingw-w64-i686-openssl mingw-w64-i686-zeromq mingw-w64-i686-libsodium

* Open the MingW shell via `MinGW-w64-Win64 Shell` shortcut on 64-bit Windows
  or `MinGW-w64-Win64 Shell` shortcut on 32-bit Windows. Note that if you are
  running 64-bit Windows, you will have both 64-bit and 32-bit MinGW shells.

**Cloning**

* To git clone, run:

        git clone Comming Soon

**Building**

* Change to the cloned directory, run:

        cd Ombre-1.5

* If you are on a 64-bit system, run:

        make release-static-win64

* If you are on a 32-bit system, run:

        make release-static-win32

* The resulting executables can be found in `build/release/bin`

* **Optional**: to build Windows binaries suitable for debugging on a 64-bit system, run:

        make debug-static-win64

* **Optional**: to build Windows binaries suitable for debugging on a 32-bit system, run:

        make debug-static-win32

* The resulting executables can be found in `build/debug/bin`

# Debugging

This section contains general instructions for debugging failed installs or problems encountered with Ombre. First ensure you are running the latest version built from the github repo.

### Obtaining stack traces and core dumps on Unix systems

We generally use the tool `gdb` (GNU debugger) to provide stack trace functionality, and `ulimit` to provide core dumps in builds which crash or segfault.

* To use gdb in order to obtain a stack trace for a build that has stalled:

Run the build.

Once it stalls, enter the following command:

```
gdb /path/to/ombred `pidof ombred`
```

Type `thread apply all bt` within gdb in order to obtain the stack trace

* If however the core dumps or segfaults:

Enter `ulimit -c unlimited` on the command line to enable unlimited filesizes for core dumps

Enter `echo core | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` to stop cores from being hijacked by other tools

Run the build.

When it terminates with an output along the lines of "Segmentation fault (core dumped)", there should be a core dump file in the same directory as ombred. It may be named just `core`, or `core.xxxx` with numbers appended.

You can now analyse this core dump with `gdb` as follows:

`gdb /path/to/ombred /path/to/dumpfile`

Print the stack trace with `bt`

* To run Ombre within gdb:

Type `gdb /path/to/ombred`

Pass command-line options with `--args` followed by the relevant arguments

Type `run` to run ombred

### Analysing memory corruption

We use the tool `valgrind` for this.

Run with `valgrind /path/to/ombred`. It will be slow.

# LMDB

There is an `mdb_stat` command in the LMDB source that can print statistics about the database but it's not routinely built. This can be built with the following command:

`cd ~/ombre/external/db_drivers/liblmdb && make`

The output of `mdb_stat -ea <path to blockchain dir>` will indicate inconsistencies in the blocks, block_heights and block_info table.

The output of `mdb_dump -s blocks <path to blockchain dir>` and `mdb_dump -s block_info <path to blockchain dir>` is useful for indicating whether blocks and block_info contain the same keys.

These records are dumped as hex data, where the first line is the key and the second line is the data.
